<h3>Inverted Index</h3>

I have implemented here a inverted index using Java. It supports input from files and simple query search.

<h4>Usage:</h4>
1) Rename the documents you want to index as filex.txt,where x is the no. of the file. Make sure to start it from 0.
2) Copy the files to the same directory in which you have the .java file. Otherwise, make sure to set path in the File object initialization.
3) Then compile the .java file and you are ready to go.. :)

P.S: the first input is the no. of files :D
